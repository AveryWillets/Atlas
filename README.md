# Atlas
Atlas is an innovative data preparation tool that accelerates the preparation process by visually flagging errors in the dataset.

Atlas currently operates via three error filtering functions:

1. Null Values - Atlas fills null value cells with red
2. Wrong Datatypes - Atlas fills wrong dtype cells with yellow
3. Outliers - Atlas fills outliers with blue

Atlas also presents summary statistics and a visual representation of each error count for even faster error recognition.

My current/future plans for Atlas include:

1. Flexible summary visualizations so users can filter based on column.
2. Real-time editing of the attached file.
3. Additional filter functions the user can select and deselect.
4. Stretch Goal: Add flexible filter functions for users to implement.

Atlas is my Student Innovation Project for the University of Advancing Technology.
